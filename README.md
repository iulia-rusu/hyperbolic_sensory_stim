# network_states

This project is collection of notebooks and scripts related to the topics of Maximum Noise Entropy and Hyperbolic Mutlidimensional Scaling. It will focus on investigating network states and nonlinear dynamics that occur in the whole brain of c. elegans. The MNE portion recapitulates neuronal receptive fields. Meanwhile the HMDS seeks to show that the circuits in the c elegan brain exhibit a hyperbolic geometry.
